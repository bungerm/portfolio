# Mike Bunger's Portfolio

Mike Bunger is a Software Developer currently on the job hunt!
Here you will find his resume and samples of his work.
## Resume

### Graduate School Projects:
Most of the directories in this repository are code examples from grad school, which I will detail here.
- [EightPuzzle](/EightPuzzle)
  - The Eight Puzzle is a type of sliding puzzle that you have probably seen at one point in your life. [Puzzle Explanation](https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-8-Puzzle)
  - Python project using numerous Search algorithms to solve an Eight Puzzle. I am particularly proud of the implementing a generic Search method that takes the Search algorithm name as a parameter.
  - BreadthFirst, DepthFirst, Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost, BestFirst, and AStar with 3 different heuristics
- [ElevatorSimulator](/ElevatorSimulator)
  - IntelliJ IDEA project utilizing Object Orienting Design patterns and practicesto simulate elevator operation. 
  - OOP practices include Factory, Impl Objects, Data Transfer Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Information Hiding, etc.
  - Use input.json to set the number of elevators, elevator capacity, amount of floors, rate of people entering the simulation, elevator logic algorithm, etc.
  - UI code provided by professor
  
### Taylor Communications:
- Promoville
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1dp8iJF-c)
  - A VR phone experience to showcase the products provided by Taylor Communications. Move around the virtual levels, such as a bank or hospital, and find all the branded products that Taylor Communications can supply for your business!
  - Most of my time at Taylor Communications was spent working on Promoville. I learned quite a lot during my time there, such as occlusion culling, normal maps, baked and real time lighting, Unity performance profiling, 3D modelling and texture mapping.
- AR Demo
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQQEjKjleE)
  - An example of the short little demos and prototypes I would create with Taylor Communications.
  
### Rookfall:

- Puzzle Game for Android/iOS
- www.rookfall.com
- To create levels, I randomly generated the board state, used a breadth first search to see if the board is solvable, and determined approximately how difficult the puzzle was by the number of moves it took to solve it. I created an editor that could generate a given amount of levels of a given difficulty (numbers of moves to solve), load any given level so I could test it personally, edit the level, and save it to an xml.
- For more on the development process, check out the Rookfall readme

### Undergraduate School Projects:
And for fun, here are some gifs of my old undergraduate projects.
