Mike Bunger is a Software Developer currently on the job hunt!
Here you will find his resume and samples of his work.

### Personal Projects:
Currently fiddling with a **Raspberry Pi** and churning through **Linux Device Drivers**, stay tuned...

### Graduate School Projects:
Most of the directories in this repository are code examples from grad school, which I will detail here.
- [EightPuzzle](/EightPuzzle)
  - **Python, Search Algorithms**
  - The Eight Puzzle is a type of sliding puzzle that you have probably seen at one point in your life. [Puzzle Explanation](https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-8-Puzzle)
  - Python project using numerous Search algorithms to solve an Eight Puzzle. General Search function that takes the Search algorithm name as a parameter.
  - BreadthFirst, DepthFirst, Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost, BestFirst, and AStar with 3 different heuristics
- [ElevatorSimulator](/ElevatorSimulator)
  - **Java, IntelliJ, Object Oriented Programming, Elevator Simulation**
  - IntelliJ IDEA project utilizing Object Orienting Design patterns and practices to simulate elevator operation. 
  - OOP practices include Factory, Impl Objects, Data Transfer Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Information Hiding, etc.
  - Use input.json to set the number of elevators, elevator capacity, amount of floors, rate of people entering the simulation, elevator logic algorithm, etc.
- [GPProject](/GPProject)
  - **C++, Visual Studio, 3D Particle System, Optimization**
  - Game Particle System Optimization Project. Students were given a poorly optimized OpenGL based Particle System and competed to see who could optimize it best.
  - Directory has two Visual Studio projects, [GPUnoptimized](/GPProject/GPUnoptimized) is the unoptimized project, while [GPOptimized](/GPProject/GPOptimized) is my optimized version.
  - Improved particle system time by a factor of 9.19 with techniques like SIMD, Data Alignment, Replacing STL containers with Linked Lists, moving invariants out of loops, and other Cache considerations.
- [KnowYourGovernment](/KnowYourGovernment)
  - **Java, Android Studio, ASyncTask, Google Civic API**
  - Android project utilizing Google Civics API, displays members of US government based on location, displays their official photo, address, phone, websites, and media accounts.
  - Uses geolocation to set default location, parses JSON from the API, loads data objects into RecyclerView via AsyncTask.
- [MemorySystem](/MemorySystem)
  - **C++, Visual Studio, Memory Management System**
  - Memory management system overwriting global new and delete, allowing for setting of data alignment with normal and fixed heaps. Uses Win32 memory management functions. Secret pointer at end of block, pointing to block header.
  - Dramatic performance improvement over standard windows memory management.
- [NameGenerator](/NameGenerator)
  - **Python, Markov Models**
  - Name Generator takes a corpus of boys and girls names, generates a Markov Model for each, and creates a number of names from the model.
  - Asks for "male or female: ", "min name length: ", "max name length: ", "order of model: ", and "number of names: ".
- [GIS Study - Japan's Declining Population](https://github.com/bungerm/portfolio/blob/main/Japan%E2%80%99s%20Declining%20Population.pdf)
  - **Geographic Information System, ArcGIS**
  - Investigative study using GIS maps to explore the nature of Japan's declining population. Dataset used is Statistical Observations of Municipalities 2020 by the Statistics Bureau of Japan
  - Methodologies are detailed in the report. Maps begin of page 6. Very interesting findings!
  
### Taylor Communications:
- Promoville
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1dp8iJF-c)
  - A VR phone experience to showcase the products provided by Taylor Communications. Move around the virtual levels, such as a bank or hospital, and find all the branded products that Taylor Communications can supply for your business!
  - Most of my time at Taylor Communications was spent working on Promoville. I learned quite a lot during my time there, such as occlusion culling, normal maps, baked and real time lighting, Unity performance profiling, 3D modelling and texture mapping.
- AR Demo
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQQEjKjleE)
  - An example of the short little demos and prototypes I would create with Taylor Communications.
  
### Rookfall:
- Puzzle Game for Android/iOS
- Read the [Rookfall README](https://github.com/bungerm/portfolio/blob/main/RookfallREADME.md)
- www.rookfall.com
- To create levels, I randomly generated the board state, used a breadth first search to see if the board is solvable, and determined approximately how difficult the puzzle was by the number of moves it took to solve it. I created an editor that could generate a given amount of levels of a given difficulty (numbers of moves to solve), load any given level so I could test it personally, edit the level, and save it to an XML.

### Undergraduate School Projects:
And for fun, here are some gifs of my old undergraduate projects.
