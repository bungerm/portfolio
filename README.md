# Mike Bunger's Portfolio

Mike Bunger is a Software Developer currently on the job hunt!
Here you will find his resume and samples of his work.
## Resume

### Graduate School Projects:
Most of the directories in this repository are code examples from grad school, which I will detail here.
- [EightPuzzle](/EightPuzzle)
  - Python, Search Algorithms
  - The Eight Puzzle is a type of sliding puzzle that you have probably seen at one point in your life. [Puzzle Explanation](https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-8-Puzzle)
  - Python project using numerous Search algorithms to solve an Eight Puzzle. I am particularly proud of the implementing a generic Search method that takes the Search algorithm name as a parameter.
  - BreadthFirst, DepthFirst, Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost, BestFirst, and AStar with 3 different heuristics
- [ElevatorSimulator](/ElevatorSimulator)
  - Java, IntelliJ, Object Oriented Programming, Elevator Simulation
  - IntelliJ IDEA project utilizing Object Orienting Design patterns and practices to simulate elevator operation. 
  - OOP practices include Factory, Impl Objects, Data Transfer Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Information Hiding, etc.
  - Use input.json to set the number of elevators, elevator capacity, amount of floors, rate of people entering the simulation, elevator logic algorithm, etc.
- [GPProject](/GPProject)
  - C++, Visual Studio, 3D Particle System, Optimization
  - Game Particle System Optimization Project. Students were given a poorly optimized OpenGL based Particle System and competed to see who could optimize it best.
  - Directory has two Visual Studio projects, [GPUnoptimized](/GPProject/GPUnoptimized) is the unoptimized project, while [GPOptimized](/GPProject/GPOptimized) is my optimized version.
  - I was able to improve the particle system time by a factor of 9.19 with techniques like SIMD, Data Alignment, Replacing STL containers with Linked Lists, moving invariants out of loops, and other Cache considerations.
  - WARNING - There are blocks of commented out code, and a lack of proper comments. This was a contest where I experimented a tremendous amount. Blocks of commented out code were kept to quickly try combinations of solutions for optimization.
  
### Taylor Communications:
- Promoville
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1dp8iJF-c)
  - A VR phone experience to showcase the products provided by Taylor Communications. Move around the virtual levels, such as a bank or hospital, and find all the branded products that Taylor Communications can supply for your business!
  - Most of my time at Taylor Communications was spent working on Promoville. I learned quite a lot during my time there, such as occlusion culling, normal maps, baked and real time lighting, Unity performance profiling, 3D modelling and texture mapping.
- AR Demo
  - [Demo Video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQQEjKjleE)
  - An example of the short little demos and prototypes I would create with Taylor Communications.
  
### Rookfall:

- Puzzle Game for Android/iOS
- Read the [Rookfall README](https://github.com/bungerm/portfolio/blob/main/RookfallREADME.md)
- www.rookfall.com
- To create levels, I randomly generated the board state, used a breadth first search to see if the board is solvable, and determined approximately how difficult the puzzle was by the number of moves it took to solve it. I created an editor that could generate a given amount of levels of a given difficulty (numbers of moves to solve), load any given level so I could test it personally, edit the level, and save it to an XML.

### Undergraduate School Projects:
And for fun, here are some gifs of my old undergraduate projects.
